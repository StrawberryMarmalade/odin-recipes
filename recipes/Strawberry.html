        <h2>Description</h2>

This is the area of the recipe where I tell you the story about how my great grandmother taught me to make Strawberry Marmalade
back when I was a child, and now I make this recipe all the time for my friends and family and everyone clapped.
        <p>Anyway.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>1/2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbs lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp lemon zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and slice the strawberries, removing the hulls and green tops</li>
            <li>Add them to a saucepan, and mix the sugar well.</li>
            <li>Stir continually over medium heat, and bring the strawberries to boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, add the lemon juice and zest (if using)</li>
            <li>Boil for about 15 minutes, or until the jam reaches 220F</li>
            <li>Stir often, to make sure the jam doesn't burn</li>
            <li>Pour into a jar and allow to cool.</li>
            <li>Cover and regrigerate.</li>
            <li>Use within about 2 weeks (if it lasts that long)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
